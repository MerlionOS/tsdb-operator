# Adding custom scrape configs

中文版: [SCRAPE-CONFIGS.zh.md](SCRAPE-CONFIGS.zh.md)

The operator owns the `prometheus.yml` ConfigMap and rewrites it on every
reconcile. Hand-editing the ConfigMap will get clobbered. The supported
way to add custom scrape jobs is `spec.additionalScrapeConfigs`.

## How it works

The reconciler:

1. Stores the YAML you provide under the ConfigMap key
   `additional-scrape-configs.yml`.
2. Renders the main `prometheus.yml` with a
   [`scrape_config_files`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config_files)
   directive pointing at `/etc/prometheus/additional-scrape-configs.yml`.
3. Prometheus loads the file at startup and on
   `POST /-/reload`. Both the main and additional file are mounted from
   the same ConfigMap.

Requires Prometheus 2.43+ for the `scrape_config_files` directive (the
default image `prom/prometheus:v2.53.0` satisfies this).

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: observability.merlionos.org/v1
kind: PrometheusCluster
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  additionalScrapeConfigs: |
    - job_name: my-app
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: pod
      relabel_configs:
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
          action: keep
          regex: my-app
    - job_name: blackbox
      static_configs:
        - targets:
            - https://example.com
      metrics_path: /probe
      params:
        module: [http_2xx]
```

The value is a **top-level YAML list** of scrape entries — the same
shape Prometheus expects under the main config's `scrape_configs` key.

## Validation

The admission webhook (when `features.webhook=true`) parses the field at
`kubectl apply` time and rejects values that aren't a YAML list. It
does **not** validate every scrape-config field — Prometheus's reload
will still surface deeper errors via its log and the `/api/v1/status/config`
endpoint.

## Limitations

- **Inline only in v0.9.0.** A `secretRef` form (mount an arbitrary
  Secret of scrape files) is a natural follow-up but not in this
  release.
- **No PodMonitor / ServiceMonitor.** Those are prometheus-operator
  CRDs; this operator deliberately doesn't implement them. Pair both
  operators in the same cluster if you want both interfaces — see
  [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).
- **Reload is automatic since v0.10.0.** When the operator updates the
  ConfigMap (because `spec.additionalScrapeConfigs` or any other
  rendered field changed), it POSTs `/-/reload` to every Ready
  replica. Per-pod failures are best-effort logged, not fatal — the
  next reconcile retries, and a restart picks up the change anyway.
